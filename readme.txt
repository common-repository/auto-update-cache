== Description ==
Made CSS/JS file changes but not showing on website? this plugin will help.

Auto Update Cache allows you to update the version of all CSS and JS files automatically or manually in one click. Show latest changes to the users/viewers.

= How it works? =

By default, WordPress loads assets using query param \"ver\" in the URL (e.g., style.css?ver=4.9.6). It allows browsers to cache this files until the WordPress core will not be upgraded to a newer version.

To prevent caching of CSS and JS files, this plugin adds query param \"time\" with beautiful easy to use dashboard panel (e.g., style.css?ver=4.9.6&time=1526905286) to all links, loaded using wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script functions.
